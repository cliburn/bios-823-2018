    "## Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "the `word2vec` family of algorithms is a powerful method for converting a word into a vector that takes into account its context. There are two main ideas - in continuous bag of words, we try to predict the current word from nearby words; in continuous skip-gram, the current word is used to predict nearby words. The phrase \"nearby words\" is intentionally vague - in the simplest case, it is a sliding window of words centered on the current word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I do not like green eggs and ham\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and suppose we use a centered window of length 3,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "((I, not), do), ((do, like), not), ((not, green), like), ((like, eggs), green), ((green, and), eggs), ((eggs, ham) and)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In continuous bag of words, we make the (input, output) pairs to be\n",
    "```\n",
    "(I, do)\n",

    "(like, green)\n",
    "(eggs, green)\n",
    "(green, eggs)\n",
    "(and, eggs)\n",
    "(eggs, and)\n",
    "(ham, and)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we try to predict `do` when we see `I`, `do` when we see `not` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In continuous skip-gram, we do the inverse for (input, output) pairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "(do, I)\n",
    "(do, not)\n",
    "(not, do)\n",

    "\n",
    "That is, we try to predict `I` when we see `do`, `not` when we see `do` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this prediction, we first assign each word to a vector of some fixed length $n$ - i.e. we embed each word as an $\\mathbb{R}^n$ vector. To do a prediction for all words in the vocabulary using `softmax` would be prohibitively expensive, and is unnecessary if we are just trying to find a good embedding vector. Instead we select $k$ noise words, typically from the unigram distributions, and just train the classifier to distinguish the target word from the noise words using logistic regression (negative sampling). We use stochastic gradient descent to move the embedding word vectors (initialized randomly) until the model gives a high probability to the target words and low probability to the noise ones. If successful, words that are meaningful when substituted in the same context will be close together in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For instance, `dog` and `cat` are likely to be close together because they appear together in similar contexts like\n",
    "\n",
    "- `My pet dog|cat`\n",
    "- `Raining dogs|cats and cats|dogs`\n",
    "- `The dog|cat chased the rat`\n",
    "- `Common pets are dogs|cats`\n",
    "\n",
    "while `dog` and `apple` are less likely to occur in the same context and hence will end up further apart in the embedding space. Interestingly, the vectors resulting from vector subtraction are also meaningful since they represent analogies - the vector between `man` and `woman` is likely to be similar to that between `king` and `queen`, or `boy` and `girl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you will encounter `word2vec` again if you take a deep learning class - it is a very influential idea and has many applications beyond text processing since you can apply it to any discrete distribution where local context is meaningful (e.g. genomes). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very nice tutorial on Word2Vec that you should read if you want to learn more about the algorithm - [Part 1](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) and [Part 2](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec learns about the feature representations of *words* - there is a an extension `doc2vec` that generates a feature vector for paragraphs or documents in the same way; we may cover this in the next lecture along with other document retrieval algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other word to vector algorithms inspired by `word2vec` - for example, [`fasttext`](https://fasttext.cc), [approximate nearest neighbors](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) and `wordrank`. Conveniently, many of these are available in the `gensim.models` package."
