# Syllabus for BIOS 823

BIOS 823 (Biomedical Big Data) explains what Big Data is, the types of Big Data often encountered in medical science (free text, time series, networks, genomic sequences, and images), and common strategies for the processing and analysis of Big Data. The core topics are **data** management (use of relational and NoSQL databases), **algorithms** (the mathematics and ideas behind common applications such as dimension reduction, clustering, collaborative filtering, classification and regression), **applications** (use of algorithms on text, time series, genomic, network and image data, including basic deep learning examples), and computational strategies to improve **performance** (code profiling, native code compilation, multi-core parallelism, distributed computing, and clout platforms).
