However, for big data analysis, **Gustafson's Law** is more relevant. This says that we are nearly always interested in increasing the size of the parallelizable bits, and the ratio of parallelizable to irreducibly serial code is not a static quantity but depends on data size. For example, Gibbs sampling has an irreducibly serial nature, but for large samples, each iteration may be able perform PDF evaluations in parallel for zillions of data points."

    "The library `multiprocessing` handles task parallelism using processes. Unlike threads which share the same memory space, each process has its own memory space. Python does not allow multiple threads to run at the same time (see Global Interpretr Lock or [GIL](http://www.dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf)), and multi-threading is achieved by time slicing. Threads are useful for tasks dominated by latency (wiaitng for network to respond, I/O) but will not show a speed-up on computationally intesnive tasks due to the GIL. Hence, computationally intensive tasks need to be run as processes to see speedups. Later we will see how we can temproarily disable the GIL for parallel processing in `numba` and `cython`."
