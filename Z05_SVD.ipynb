    "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a method for finding latent similarities between documents treated as a bag of words by using a low rank approximation. It is used for document classification, clustering and retrieval. For example, LSA can be used to search for prior art given a new patent application. In this homework, we will implement a small library for simple latent semantic analysis as a practical example of the application of SVD. The ideas are very similar to PCA. SVD is also used in recommender systems in an similar fashion (for an SVD-based recommender system library, see [Surpise](http://surpriselib.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a toy example of LSA to get familiar with the ideas. If you want to use LSA or similar methods for statistical language analysis, the most efficient Python libraries are probably [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io) - these also provide an online algorithm - i.e. the training information can be continuously updated. Other useful functions for processing natural language can be found in the [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/)."

This suggests that in order to map the new document to the same concept space, first find the tf-idf vector $v$ for the new document - this must contain all (and only) the terms present in the existing tf-idx matrix. Then the query vector $q$ is given by $v^T U_k \\Sigma_k^{-1}$. Find the 10 documents most similar to the new document and the 10 most dissimilar. "
