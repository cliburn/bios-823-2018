    "In this homework, we will implement the conjugate graident descent algorithm. While you should nearly always use an optimization routine from a library for practical data analyiss, this exercise is useful because it will make concepts from multivariatble calculus and linear algebra covered in the lectrures concrete for you. Also, it brings you up the learning curve for the implementaiton of more complex algorithms than the ones you have been exposed to so far.\n",
